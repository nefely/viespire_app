			<p>Although our Service is a general audience service, we restrict the use of our Service to individuals age 16 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal data from children under 16 years of age, and no part of the Service is directed to children under the age of 16. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, you may alert us at support@viespire.app. If we learn that we have collected any personal data from children under 16, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account.</p>
			<h4 class="title_child">HIPAA</h4>
			<p>Controller is not an entity that is covered by the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (the "HIPAA"). The HIPAA privacy rules apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses, to any health care provider who transmits health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the Secretary of HHS has adopted standards under HIPAA and their service providers. This means that the information that you provide to the Company is not protected by the HIPAA privacy rules and regulations.</p>
			<h4 class="title_child">NTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h4>
			<p>Viespire is a global business. We may transfer personal data to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. We deploy safeguards if we transfer personal data originating from the EU to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law.</p>
			<p>We process data outside of the EU.</p>
			<p>In particular, to offer our Services, we need to transfer your personal data to the United States and Ukraine. The United States (except for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">Privacy Shield framework</a>) and Ukraine are not considered to provide an adequate level of protection under EU data protection law. It means that these countries do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the data.</p>
			<p>In cases prescribed by the applicable law, we use Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission as a legal mechanism for data transfers from the EU. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">Learn more</a> about the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission. These clauses are contractual commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of the data. These data transfers are necessary to provide the Service set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>
